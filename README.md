# solar2d-flappy-logo
solar2d flappy bird remake with a volunteered company logo.
currently only working within solar2d...all that lazy work disappeared but here's a gamejolt fork of the game (https://psuedodeveloper.gamejolt.io/flappy-logo/)
p.s. to quote the final words of an animated impalement (by forklift) victim "i'll see you in hell" (doesn't matter if you don't believe in it or knot).
